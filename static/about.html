        Shark Jump Calculator exists to provide an answer to the question, "Does this show that I'm
        thinking about watching ever jump the shark (i.e., suddenly get worse)"? It uses the excellent
        <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">OMDb API</a> and the equally excellent
        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/omdb/" target="_blank">omdb package</a> to fetch episode
        ratings for a television show, and then does a statistical analysis of those ratings in order
        to break a show down into discrete "quality eras", or sequences of episodes with a distinct
        average rating.

        A good test case is The Simpsons. The rating analysis correctly identifies the show's "golden
        era" as consisting of about the first nine seasons. Another good (albeit sad) test case is
        Game of Thrones, which was on its way to being the best-rated show ever until about halfway
        through season seven.
