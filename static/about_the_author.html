        I'm an aspiring software developer and a fan of quality television. This is a re-write of my
        first significant project. You can see the original at 
        <a href="https://sharkjumptimeline.com" target="_blank">sharkjumptimeline.com</a> (warning: the
        original is very slow, sometimes times out for valid shows, and is U-G-L-Y ugly). I'm also an
        avid chess player, and you can see my second significant project (which is chess related) at
        <a href="https://acpltracker.com" target="_blank">acpltracker.com</a>.
